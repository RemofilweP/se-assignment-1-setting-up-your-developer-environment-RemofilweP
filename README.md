Setup Development Environment

#Assignment: Setting Up Your Developer Environment

#Objective:
This assignment aims to familiarize you with the tools and configurations necessary to set up an efficient developer environment for software engineering projects. Completing this assignment will give you the skills required to set up a robust and productive workspace conducive to coding, debugging, version control, and collaboration.

#Tasks:

1. Select Your Operating System (OS):
   Choose an operating system that best suits your preferences and project requirements. Download and Install Windows 11. https://www.microsoft.com/software-download/windows11
   - I have an intel processor and have upgraded to Windows 11 in the past which led to my system crashing. I decided to continue working with Windows 10 instead as my system can handle this version of the OS.

2. Install a Text Editor or Integrated Development Environment (IDE):
   Select and install a text editor or IDE suitable for your programming languages and workflow. Download and Install Visual Studio Code. https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
   - Prior to the programme, I had installed VS Code as a requirement for my academic studies. I found the setup quite complex and I would then use Anaconda to access Jupyter Notebook instead. I had a hard time setting up the PATH for VS Code but I was able to do so for this programme after following through the lecture videos.

3. Set Up Version Control System:
   Install Git and configure it on your local machine. Create a GitHub account for hosting your repositories. Initialize a Git repository for your project and make your first commit. https://github.com
   - Similarly I had already set up a GitHub account but I only started working with it because of this programme. My first commit was with the first assignment we had.

4. Install Necessary Programming Languages and Runtimes:
  Instal Python from http://wwww.python.org programming language required for your project and install their respective compilers, interpreters, or runtimes. Ensure you have the necessary tools to build and execute your code.
  - I had already installed and recently was able to add it to my local PATH. ![alt text](Picture2-1.png)
  -  I also had VS Code, IDLE IDE and Anaconda as my Python environments IDEs. ![IDE1](Picture3.png), ![IDE2](Picture4.png), ![IDE3](Picture5.png)
5. Install Package Managers:
   If applicable, install package managers like pip (Python).
   - I also installed pip during my academic career. ![alt text](Picture6.png)
6. Configure a Database (MySQL):
   Download and install MySQL database. https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/windows/installer/5.7.html
   - This is another one of the applications I had prior to the programme and have been previously installed. ![alt text](Picture7.png)

7. Set Up Development Environments and Virtualization (Optional):
   Consider using virtualization tools like Docker or virtual machines to isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent environments across different machines.
   - I opted to use my local environment for my development journey.

8. Explore Extensions and Plugins:
   Explore available extensions, plugins, and add-ons for your chosen text editor or IDE to enhance functionality, such as syntax highlighting, linting, code formatting, and version control integration.
   - I appreciate that VS Code allows me to read in my files in a colourful format and I have since installed CSV Rainbow for this very reason. I also like how I can change the theme for both VS Code and Juptyer Notebook. I actually changed my Jupyter Notebook environment to a shade of pink/purple for the visual appeal. My VS Code environe\ment is in Dark theme for the same reason.


9. Document Your Setup:
    Create a comprehensive document outlining the steps you've taken to set up your developer environment. Include any configurations, customizations, or troubleshooting steps encountered during the process. 
    - Setting up my Developer environment was relatively easy as all of the applications except Git Bash were already installed. I was finally able to create set up the PATH for Python to be able to use it in my local machine, which makes it much easier to work on my machine without having to launch Jupyter Notebook. I also like the fact that I now know how to connect to Git Hub from my local machine using Git Bash as this was something I did not know how to do.

#Deliverables:
- Document detailing the setup process with step-by-step instructions and screenshots where necessary.
- A GitHub repository containing a sample project initialized with Git and any necessary configuration files (e.g., .gitignore).
- A reflection on the challenges faced during setup and strategies employed to overcome them.

#Submission:
Submit your document and GitHub repository link through the designated platform or email to the instructor by the specified deadline.

#Evaluation Criteria:**
- Completeness and accuracy of setup documentation.
- Effectiveness of version control implementation.
- Appropriateness of tools selected for the project requirements.
- Clarity of reflection on challenges and solutions encountered.
- Adherence to submission guidelines and deadlines.

Note: Feel free to reach out for clarification or assistance with any aspect of the assignment.
